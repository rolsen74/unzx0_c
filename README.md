A decompressor for the ZX0 format written in C. This is a very dirty translation of the 68000 version by Emmanuel Marty.

ZX0 by Einar Saukas, a successor to ZX7, reaches compression ratios in the ballpark of Exomizer, without requiring any decompression tables.

Use Salvador or ZX0 for compression here.

The ZX0 depacker is available under the zlib license. You can use it in any way that you like.
