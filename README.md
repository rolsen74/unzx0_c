A decompressor for the ZX0 format written in C. This is a very dirty translation of the [68000](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/unzx0_68000) version by Emmanuel Marty.

ZX0 by Einar Saukas, a successor to ZX7, reaches compression ratios in the ballpark of Exomizer, without requiring any decompression tables.

Use [Salvador](https://github.com/emmanuel-marty/salvador) or [ZX0](https://github.com/einar-saukas/ZX0) for compression here.

The ZX0 depacker is available under the zlib license. You can use it in any way that you like.
